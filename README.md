# lichessCopy

This is a copy of Lichess.Org just in order to show I am able to create this kind of website from scratch.
The purpose is to handle all the front-end only with html, css, js and all the back-end with python.
The chess AI will be stockfish (and a deepLearning AI in the future maybe ?)
